# OpenSS13-1.0-Revival
Updating the OpenSS13 codebase to the latest version of byond. You can find the origonal version at http://sourceforge.net/projects/openss13/ and you can discuss casually at http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=11074&amp;p=235949#p235949

This is probably better if you want something by somebody who knows byond code: https://github.com/Mloc/openss13
